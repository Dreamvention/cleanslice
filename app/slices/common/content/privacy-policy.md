## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy outlines how we, Cleanslice, handle your personal information when you use our AI agent SaaS services ("Service") on our websites, modules, and platforms. It applies to the information collected through our Service or our website, Cleanslice (the "Website"). Capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy have the meanings defined herein or as set forth in the User Agreement on the Website.

By accepting this Privacy Policy and the User Agreement, you expressly consent to the collection, storage, use, and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is effective upon acceptance for new users and is otherwise effective as of September 1, 2024.

## 2. Types of Data We Collect

### Personal Data

Personal Data refers to information that identifies or can be used to contact you, including your name, address, phone number, email address, and any other non-public information linked to these details.

### Anonymous Data

Anonymous Data refers to information that does not directly or indirectly identify you. This data is not linked to your Personal Data and does not permit identification of individual persons.

You may browse our Website without revealing any Personal Data. However, once you provide us with your Personal Data, you are no longer anonymous to us. By choosing to provide Personal Data, you consent to the transfer and storage of that information on our servers located in the United States.

We may collect and store the following Personal Data:

- Information about your interactions with our Website, Service, and content, including device ID, IP address, page views, traffic data, and web log information.
- Additional verification information, such as ID or address verification, if required for site policy compliance.
- Demographic and navigation data from other companies, which may be added to the information we have collected from you.
- Feedback or other content you provide via email or other communication channels.

### Information Collected via Technology

Our servers, potentially hosted by third-party service providers, collect information such as your browser type, operating system, IP address, domain name, and date/time of visits.

Cookies are small pieces of data stored on your device; we may use session cookies (which expire after your session) and persistent cookies (which remain on your device until deleted).

### Information Collected from Third Parties

We may receive Personal and/or Anonymous Data from third parties that provide services on our behalf or offer their products through our Service. This data may be combined with the information we have already collected to improve the Service we provide.

### Registration and Sharing Through Third-Party Services

We may offer single sign-on services, allowing you to use third-party credentials to access our Service. With your permission, Cleanslice may import profile information from these third-party services. You can manage or discontinue such sharing through your preference settings.

### Information You Share on Cleanslice

Certain optional information you provide, such as your full name, may be displayed publicly on the Website and connected to your Cleanslice activity. Please be aware that if you access the Website from a shared computer, some of your information may be visible to others.

In such cases, we will disclose relevant information such as name, city, state, ZIP code, telephone number, email address, User ID history, IP address, fraud complaints, and bidding and listing history.
- Other business entities if we plan to merge with or be acquired by another business. In such events, the new entity will be required to adhere to this Privacy Policy with respect to your Personal Data.
