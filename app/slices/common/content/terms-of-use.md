## 3. Subscriptions

### Subscription Period

Certain parts of the Service may be available only with a paid Subscription. You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (such as daily, weekly, monthly, or annually), depending on the Subscription plan You select when purchasing the Subscription.

Your Subscription will automatically renew at the end of each period under the same conditions unless You cancel it or the Company cancels it.

### Subscription Cancellations

You may cancel Your Subscription renewal through Your Account settings page or by contacting the Company. You will not receive a refund for the fees already paid for Your current Subscription period, but You will retain access to the Service until the end of Your current Subscription period.

If the Subscription was made through an In-app Purchase, You can cancel the renewal of Your Subscription through the Application Store.

### Billing

You must provide the Company with accurate and complete billing information, including your full name, address, state, ZIP code, telephone number, and a valid payment method.

If automatic billing fails for any reason, the Company will issue an electronic invoice requiring manual payment by a specified deadline, corresponding to the billing period indicated on the invoice.

If the Subscription was made through an In-app Purchase, all billing is handled by the Application Store and is governed by the Application Store’s terms and conditions.

### Fee Changes

The Company, in its sole discretion, may modify the Subscription fees at any time. Any changes in Subscription fees will become effective at the end of the then-current Subscription period.

The Company will provide reasonable prior notice of any changes in Subscription fees, allowing You to terminate Your Subscription before the change becomes effective.

Your continued use of the Service after the fee change takes effect constitutes Your agreement to pay the modified fee amount.

### Refunds

Paid Subscription fees are non-refundable, except when required by law.

Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by the Company on a case-by-case basis and granted at the sole discretion of the Company.

If the Subscription was made through an In-app Purchase, the Application Store’s refund policy will apply. Refund requests should be directed to the Application Store.

### Free Trial

The Company may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a Free Trial for a limited period.

You may be required to enter billing information to sign up for the Free Trial.

If You enter billing information when signing up for a Free Trial, You will not be charged until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial, unless You have canceled Your Subscription, You will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the selected Subscription.

The Company reserves the right to modify or cancel the Free Trial offer at any time without notice.

## 4. In-app Purchases

The Application may include In-app Purchases, which allow You to buy products, services, or Subscriptions.

Details on managing In-app Purchases using your Device may be found in the Application Store’s terms and conditions or in your Device’s Help settings.

In-app Purchases can only be used within the Application. Once initiated, In-app Purchases cannot be canceled. They cannot be redeemed for cash, transferred, or exchanged for other consideration.

If an In-app Purchase fails to download or does not function correctly after being downloaded, We will investigate the issue and act reasonably to provide a replacement or patch. In no case will We charge You for this. If We cannot resolve the issue within a reasonable time, We will authorize the Application Store to refund You up to the cost of the relevant In-app Purchase.

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Company or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other information, business interruption, personal injury, loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use the Service, third-party software and/or third-party hardware used with the Service, or otherwise in connection with any provision of these Terms), even if the Company or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In such jurisdictions, each party’s liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.

The Service is provided to You "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all faults and defects without warranty of any kind.

Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with any other software, applications, systems, or services, operate without interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards, or be error-free or that any errors or defects can or will be corrected.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to You. But in such a case, the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent enforceable under applicable law.
